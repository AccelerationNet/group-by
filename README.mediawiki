= group-by = 
A Common Lisp library to help group data into trees (of various
formats) based on common/shared values


== API ==
=== group-by ===
groups the list into an alist using the key function and value function to group by key,
with a list of all values for that key.

key is used to determine the key in the a-list <br />
value is used to determin the value in the a-list <br />
key-fn is passed as the :key to assoc (essentially the key of your key) <br />
test is passed as the :test to assoc <br />

eg: (group-by '((a 1 2) (a 3 4) (b 5 6)))
 => ((A (1 2) (3 4)) (B (5 6)))

eg: (group-by '((a 1 2) (a 3 4) (b 5 6)) :value #'identity)
 => ((A (A 1 2) (A 3 4)) (B (B 5 6)))
